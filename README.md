# My Data Analysis Journey

## Hi I'm Adegunju Mercy OloladeðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Analyst in the making. Iâ€™m currently learning through the ALX program and documenting my growth here.

Even though I havenâ€™t worked on any real-world projects yet, this repo is where I test what Iâ€™m learning, from simple data cleaning to building small reports with Excel, SQL Tableau and Power BI.

## ðŸ“Œ What you'll find here:
- Practice with sample datasets 
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Charts and visuals 
- SQL practice and queries
- Excel dashboards
- Notes and learning logs

## ðŸ“š Tools I'm learning:
- Excel
- SQL
- Tableau
- Power BI 

## ðŸš§ Status:
Work in progress. I update as I learn. Feel free to check out any notebook and follow the journey.

### ðŸŒ± How I Learn
Everything here is based on what Iâ€™m learning in real time. Mistakes, edits, and improvements included. It's raw. It's honest. And itâ€™s me growing in public.
